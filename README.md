## **Setup**

It is assumed you have already installed the following on your computer:

- Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>
- npm
- server-hae --> make sure you follow the instructions provided in the repository's README

## **Deploy**

**Before diving into running any files after downloading and unzipping the zip folder, you need to execute `npm install` on your terminal/console to install all the necessary dependencies (you may need to use `sudo` if you are executing this command on a Mac)**

*Make sure you have the `MongoDB` and `server-hae` running on independent Terminal windows before you execute the following command*

- On a different Terminal window, navigate into the project folder and type `npm start`, then press enter 

- If everything has been set up properly a new tab should open on your default browser

## **Additional Info**

- If your default browser is Google Chrome and you have the CORS browser application installed, make sure it is enabled or it may prevent you from performing any API Requests on the server-hae
